# Survival-analysis-for-HIV-patients
To perform survival analysis of patients undergoing two types of treatments for AIDS and predicting the risk involved and time for event (death) to occur from a specified starting point in time.
Tools : Excel, R Studio(Survival package ,KMSurv package)
Techniques: 
Fomulating Kaplan-Meier estimate and pointwise bounds
Forming confidence bands
Analysing difference between groups
Building Cox proportional hazard model 

Overall Survival refers to the time a patient survives after a particular event, e.g. date of first treatment or date of surgery(In this case , the days after diagnosis of HIV). If the patient is still alive, OS is taken until the last follow-up time. If a patient has died, the end date is the date of death. 
Survival/censoring:Patients may have censored survival times if death or recurrence has not yet occurred (or there is no evidence to show that either has occurred). This could happen when:
they drop-out of the study, e.g. they stop attending clinics for follow-up
the study has a fixed time-line and recurrence or death occurs after the cut-off
Survival analysis helps to provide better and effective treatment for patients and to increase the longevity of patient life span by studying the historical data about patients ,drugs and diseases.
